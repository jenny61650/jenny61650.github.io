"},{"The Bodybuilding Transformation System - Beginner":"IMPORTANT PROGRAM NOTES (READ BEFORE STARTING)\r\n\r\n● Perform a full general warm-up and exercise-specific warm-up every workout as outlined below (should only take 5-10 mins max)\r\n\r\n● Note that for the first week of the program, most sets are taken to an RPE of ~6-7. This means you will be leaving 3-4 reps in the tank on most exercises. This only lasts for the first week (to serve as a deload/intro week). After the first week, the intensity will increase and you’ll start taking most sets to ~2-3 reps shy of failure.\r\n\r\n● All working sets are broken up into Early Sets and Last Sets. The Early Sets are all the sets that come before your Last Set. Usually the Early Sets should be a little bit easier than the later sets (slightly lower RPE) whereas the Last Set is pushed closer to failure. In the first two weeks of the program, there will only be one working set for each exercise, so there is only a Last Set RPE. See the Bodybuilding Transformation System Guidebook for a full explanation of RPE.\r\n\r\n● Each exercise has a clickable link which demonstrates how to perform the exercise. I suggest watching each exercise demo before starting the workout.\r\n\r\n● All other aspects of the program, including when to make an exercise substitution and how to progress through the rep ranges given is explained in the Bodybuilding Transformation System Guidebook. Give it a full read before starting your first workout!
